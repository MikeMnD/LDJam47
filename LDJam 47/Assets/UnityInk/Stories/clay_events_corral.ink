You never even see the Hunter-Killer before it is already above you, a shadow of death momentarily blotting out the sun. You hit the grass, praying to the Ancestors it is not looking for you. It passes you by with the roar of a dragon, its wings laden with death.

You get up after you are sure it really is not turning around for you. You make note of the direction it was headed. Hunter-Killers are very rare this close to the Corral. There are only a few reasons why one would be sent here by the City...none of them good.

You come across a very strange scene. Broken drones lie amidst a glitch-chaos of broken City architecture. Everything feels wrong; you are not sure why, but it feels like a violation took place here, a violation of the City that even the dozen sec-bots lying around could not stop.

->comp_corral_hk_comment2->

This must have happened relatively recently. You think of the Hunter-Killer you saw earlier. Could they be connected, somehow? This <i>was</i> the direction it had headed in...

Your instinct - that a violation had occurred - is almost certainly correct. It is as if the City was forced against its own will to form shields and weapons for some unknown assailant, which were then wielded with sudden and deadly force against the sec-bots.

They point out the ossified spears holding a pierced bot mid-air; another bot smothered as if the ground itself rose to swallow it. Scorch-marks from the sec-bots' char-guns scouring a wall, hastily raised from the ground.

Yet when you look at the ossified spear that seems to have pierced a bot mid-air, the strange walls peppered with char-ray marks, the only other explanation would be that the City - for some reason - is at war with itself.

Your scout stops you and points to the sky down a street. You squint; several City-drones are converging, small pinpricks circling and diving. <i>Vulture-drones.</i> Whatever it is that attracted them will soon be gone, cut into pieces and carried away to the Cityâ€™s incinerators.

{playful: You feel a surge of excitement. Whatever they are circling, it must be recent. Who knows what treasure there is to be found?}{thoughtful: There are many stories of Vulture-drones. In most of them, the drones are indifferent to humans; in some, it is suggested humans and Vulture-drones share a common task, and the Vulture-drones are happy to let humans scavenge instead of them.}{honorable: Vulture-drones could mean a battle, or it could mean a piece of wall has collapsed.

A woman emerges from the doorway to the stack: it is the healer you saw cursing - or blessing - you from the rock. Behind her, cowering inside the stack, are several children of various ages, dirty and thin. You ask her to explain herself.

She offers to share a meal with you, promising this clearing is safe, and to tell you her story. You accept, noting she has food this time.

She was cast out from her community for her Boze-worship, despite being their only Shaman. The children were her former students who had come to look for her: she was escorting them back to the village when she found it had been swallowed whole by the City after they tore down her protective sigils. Since then she has wandered, finding food for the children where she can.

You decide to try it too, wondering if perhaps your Baba has some news. Although you doubt it; the couriers that update the pillars do not come by that often. To your surprise, you do find a message left for you, however not one you expected.

It is a long diatribe, accusing your father of infidelity, deception and misrule, claiming you are a fraud and the false heir, and that in truth your father never sired anyone as his balls are as frigid as your mother's womb.

Remembering the message from a 'Truthseeker', you decide to follow. You tell your wercru to hold back slightly and then accompany the man.

You soon arrive at a clearing where half-built glitch-structures rise out of the grass, providing seating for the dozen or so people listening to the orator, a grey-bearded man standing on top of a cracked dome, shouting at the tribesmen who have gathered to listen to him.

He does not notice you at first, letting you hear what he has to say. Most of it is a rehash of what you read on the pillar-of-messages, but with more spittle. You look around: no-one seems especially impressed, but you do know you cannot let this stand.

Public speaking is a time-honored tradition among the ElbÃ©ar, and anyone who commands the attention of more than one should expect to have their message questioned.

Eventually you go on to the more important questions, such as his own motivations for making these claims, and where exactly he is getting his information from.

The man splutters and attempts his best to answer, but you run oratorial circles around him in short order. His audience becomes your audience, and you make them laugh until he is boo'd off the stage. As he makes to slink away with his tail between his legs you intercept him - the rest of your wercru arriving as you do, disinclining any attempts at physical violence.

Now that you have him alone, he explains - red-faced and embarrassed - that your father threw him out of the Corral many, many years ago, when you were but an infant, for 'injust reasons' - although you doubt it. Your father is many things, but injust is not one of them.

When he heard your father was dying he decided to celebrate it, and in a moment of drunken bravado claimed your father was dry-balled. When asked to explain you, he had to start inventing the entire conspiracy of the 'false heir' in order to save face. From there, it spiralled.

You tell him to stop spreading lies and send him on your way, although you have a feeling it wouldn't even be necessary. His audience will spread the story of what happened here far and wide, and even if this 'Truthseeker' made another attempt on your name he'd simply be laughed out.

Once he is done he motions at a bowl and encourages those moved by his words to leave a little something for him to eat, as he spends every moment occupied with seeking the truth. A few charitable souls leave a morsel or two, which he eyes hungrily. Before he has time to collect his gains, you intercept him.

The rest of the audience having largely dispersed, it is just you and your wercru. {warriors>1: He eyes your warriors with especial worry.} When he realizes who you are, all of his previous bravado melts away.

It is a Custodian-bot, moss-bearded and cranky, hovering on three engines. You stand frozen while it belts out loud commands in the language of the Bozes. {skillCheck(_shaman, easy): A shaman helpfully interprets: 'It wants you to follow it.'|It does not take a shaman to understand what it wants: to follow it.}

{companions?Chi: Chi tugs your sleeve. ->Say("'Don't even try to follow it. These things can lead you through swamp-lands for days if you let them. Just try to slip away.'", Chi)->|You wonder if it's worth it to follow it. You've heard stories of Custodian bots like these stringing wercrus along for days.}

While you walk behind the bot, a Clayworker slips to the side to create the buzzle-blanket. <>

You throw the blanket yourself over the back of the bot as it dips down a hill, and then you run! A cacophony of angry buzzing follows you, but luckily nothing else.

It takes you some time to find an opportune moment to slip away. When the moment comes, it is accompanied by a lot of running through the underbrush and an uncomfortably long time spent hiding inside a tunnel, half-submerged, while the Custodian-bot looks for you. But you did get away.

You crest a hill just when you hear the sound of a bot somewhere ahead. You quickly order your wercru to hide while you keep watch yourself. When the bot appears, you nearly gasp in surprise.  It is the Custodian-bot you gave the slip to earlier. {evts_corral.trickster1.option1: It is still trailing remnants of the black buzzle-blanket, causing it to list terribly.| It looks angry and a bit dustier and more scratched than before.} It is clearly on the hunt. You stay quiet until you are sure it has disappeared, feeling a knot of worry form in your stomach. Can bots carry grudges?

When you hear the sound of a drone buzzing, you half-panic when you recognize the cadence of its motors. But you have no time to escape: the green-tinted, moss-covered, scratched old Custodian-bot almost flies right into you, its clay-light an angry red. You stand still like children scolded by their parents, wondering how you will get away this time. After a moment, the bot turns again - it wants you to follow.

You arrive at your destination before you have time to consider a new plan to slip away. It is an open space, with stonework pavements and a large, round, water-filled basin in the center. You cannot imagine what the Ancients used it for. You immediately notice that the space is taken care of: bushes and grass pruned, trees killed before they grow too big. There are cats everywhere, enjoying the sun-warmed stone.

You soon realize the cats are the problem. The Custodian-bot buzzes up to them, but the cats seem to have gotten used to the bot, and barely budge when it tries to chase them away. They look at you, newcomers, with suspicious eyes. The Custodian-bot returns to you and shouts some more commands. Then it sees a weed pushing its way through a crack and moves to interecept.

Your wercru looks at you, at a total loss. This is new.

{evts_corral_advanced_success && not evts_corral_advanced_fumbled:
Somehow, you do it. You organize your tribesmen to gather the cats one by one while you keep the bot busy. The cats soon wisen up to your cat-stealing ways and begin slipping away, but you capture as many as you can. Bags and arms and everything that can hold an angry feral cat is employed to keep them in check. Finally, with most of them gathered, you escape. If you didn't know any better, the bot almost looks pleased. 
{GiveReward(_tricksterXP, largeReward)}

You let the cats go some distance away, knowing they will probably make their way back to the square sooner rather than later. You just hope the bot will have forgotten you by then.
- else:
You do your very best to herd to cats, but whatever you do more and more of them slip away from you. More cats appear, as if curious to find out what you are doing. Somehow, it seems, your presence has made things <i>worse</i>. There is meowing. There is scratching. You think you might have misplaced some of your tribesmen in the horde of cats.

The Custodian-bot, finally, flies up above the whole square and surveys the situation. Perhaps seeing the impossibility of it, you watch as it turns around slowly, turning off its clay-light, and buzzing away, finally abandoning its post. You drop the cats you managed to catch and sneak away.

This bot clearly has no way of communicating with the City, or if it does, the City does not listen to it. You do not have time to herd cats, or to act its servant. But you cannot risk it chasing after you across the whole City either.

You consider simply attacking it, but then you notice some of the cats seem to enjoy hunting the bot, even as it tries to do its job. {evts_corral.trickster1.option1: The small bits of buzzle-blanket that still cling to it gives you the idea.| A small flower stuck between two metal plates that attracts the attention of one rumbunctious cat gives you an idea.}

You collect some string and fashion a simple cat-toy out of it. Some of the younger kittens immediately seem interested. You wait until the bot is still, pruning a bit of weed with its barely-functional heat-ray, and carefully bind the string to its rear motor, and then step back.

With something to actually grab on to, the cats immediately begin to play. Cat after cat swipes after the bot as it sweeps past. A fat tabby jumps up and grabs the string with all four paws, and the bot crashes to the ground. The cat escapes at the last moment. The drone does not get back up. You gather your wercru and leave, leaving the square to the cats.

You see a cat following you, and wonder briefly it's one of the ones from the square with the cats and the Custodian-bot. You try to lure it over, but it hisses at you and runs off. Fair.
